### Hi there üëã

- My name is Diego and I'm a Chemical Engineering student. Also, I study fullstack web programming, with focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Java.
- I love Chemical Engineering and programming, due to that I'm in a research with Laborat√≥rio de Computa√ß√£o Cient√≠fica e Visualiza√ß√£o (LCCV) developing programs focused on engineering!
- My passion for these both areas motivates me to do personal projects engeneering-oriented too! But not only that, I enjoy programming applications that are actually functional in my life and in the others.


- In addition to my professional/academic pursuits:
- I love music, playing rock with my eletric guitar is one of my favourites hobbies. 
- I like to practice sports, and I'm interested in a wide range of it. 
- I enjoy playing and watching Formula One, and my favorite driver is Pierre Gasly, (and RedBull as a team).
