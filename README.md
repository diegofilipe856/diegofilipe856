### Hi there üëã

- My name is Diego and I'm a Chemical Engineering student :construction_worker:. Also, I study fullstack web programming, with focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Java. :man_technologist:
- I love Chemical Engineering and programming, due to that I'm in a research with Laborat√≥rio de Computa√ß√£o Cient√≠fica e Visualiza√ß√£o (LCCV) developing programs focused on engineering! :man_student:
- My passion for these both areas motivates me to do personal projects engeneering-oriented too! But not only that, I enjoy programming applications that are actually functional in my life and in the others. :rocket:


- In addition to my professional/academic pursuits:
- I love music, playing rock with my eletric guitar is one of my favourites hobbies. :guitar::notes:
- I like to practice sports, and I'm interested in a wide range of them. :weight_lifting_man::man_cartwheeling:
